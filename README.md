## Overview of XRISM

- The HEASARC [XRISM page](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xrism/) is an excellent source of information for all things XRISM. Many of the other links here you can find via this page.
- The Proposers' Observatory Guide (POG) in [html](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xrism/proposals/POG/) or [pdf](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xrism/proposals/POG/xrism_pog.pdf) has everything you need to know about he XRISM observatory.

## Data analysis

- [XRISM data analysis](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xrism/analysis/index.html) web page.
- We will have to make sure we're using the latest version of [HEASoft](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/heasoft/).
- [Early release science data](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xrism/results/erdata/index.html).
- We can use [SpectralFitting.jl](https://github.com/fjebaker/SpectralFitting.jl) to fit the spectra (here is the [documentation](https://fjebaker.github.io/SpectralFitting.jl/dev/))

## Science
